# Hello 👋! I am Afolabi Victor Oluwatomisin - a Sui Move Developer

I'm a smart contract developer building on the Sui blockchain.

In just a few months, I’ve gone from zero to launching real-world projects — combining learning, coding, testing, and scripting into full stack blockchain builds.

## 🔨 What I've Built

### 🛒 Multi-Seller Marketplace
A complete on-chain marketplace for Sui:
- Sellers can list and delist items
- Buyers pay with custom tokens
- Seller profits tracked and withdrawable
- Fully tested with TypeScript scripts

### 🧾 TOMCROWN Token
A custom fungible token on Sui:
- Supply management
- Mint, send, and balance check scripts
- Built with unit tests and modular structure

### 🎟️ AccessPass NFT
An NFT system with real utility:
- NFTs with metadata and access control
- Each NFT can hold token balances (`Balance<T>`)
- Deposit, withdraw, and access verification logic
- Fully tested with TypeScript

### 📦 Batch Airdrop Contract
An efficient contract for mass distribution:
- Batch NFT or token transfer
- Ideal for giveaways, DAOs, and community rewards
- Optimized for gas and simplicity
- Fully tested with TypeScript

## 💼 Open to Collaborations & Roles
I'm currently open to:
- Smart contract/dev roles in the Sui ecosystem
- Freelance project work
- Open-source collaborations
