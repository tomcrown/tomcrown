# 👋 Hi, I'm Victor Afolabi — Sui Move Developer

I'm a smart contract developer focused on building **robust on-chain applications** using Move on the [Sui blockchain](https://sui.io).

In just a few months, I’ve gone from learning Move to shipping real-world dApps such as:

*  **Name Service (SuiNS-style)**
*  Multi-seller **Marketplace**
*  **Batch Airdrop** Contract
*  On-chain **Voting System**
*  **Token Modules** & Mint Logic
