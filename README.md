# 👋 Hi, I'm Victor Afolabi — Sui Move Developer

I'm a smart contract developer focused on building **robust on-chain applications** using Move on the [Sui blockchain](https://sui.io).

In just a few months, I’ve gone from learning Move to shipping real-world dApps such as:

* 🧾 **Name Service (SuiNS-style)**
* 🛒 Multi-seller **Marketplace**
* 🎯 **Batch Airdrop** Contract
* 🗳️ On-chain **Voting System**
* 🪙 **Token Modules** & Mint Logic
