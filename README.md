# üëã Hi, I'm Victor Afolabi ‚Äî Sui Move Developer

I'm a smart contract developer focused on building **on-chain applications** using Move on the [Sui blockchain](https://sui.io). My work focuses on building secure, scalable, and developer-friendly protocols.

I‚Äôve shipped projects such as:

*  **Treasury Lock** - A decentralized app that allows users to lock SUI or custom tokens for a fixed period and withdraw only after the lock duration ends.
*  **Name Service (SuiNS-style)** - A Sui-based decentralized naming service inspired by SuiNS.
*  **MoveVote** - A decentralized voting platform built with Sui Move.
*  **SuiFaucet** - A user-friendly interface to request test tokens on the Sui network for development and testing purposes.
  
  Other notable work:
*  Multi-seller **Marketplace**
*  **Batch Airdrop** Contract
*  **Token Modules** & Mint Logic
