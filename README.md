# ðŸ‘‹Hello, I am Afolabi Victor - a Sui Move Developer

I'm a smart contract developer building on the Sui blockchain.

In just a few months, Iâ€™ve gone from zero to launching real-world projects like a Multi-seller marketplace, token, batch airdrop contract which has involved combining learning, coding, testing, and scripting into full stack blockchain builds.


## ðŸ’¼ Open to Collaborations & Roles
I'm currently open to:
- Smart contract/dev roles in the Sui ecosystem
- Freelance project work
- Open-source collaborations

ðŸ§ª Also experienced as a testnet user across multiple chains including Sui â€” familiar with early tooling, feedback cycles & ecosystem launches.
